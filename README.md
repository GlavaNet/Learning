# Learning Programming For Cybersecurity

## Why This Exists

I am an IT professional educated in cybersecurity with experience in network engineering and
systems administration. I want to break into cybersecurity (no pun intended), and while I have 
some exposure to scripting and understand the value of learning to code, I have a problem: 
*I'm not a programmer.*

I looked for tutorials and courses to help me learn, but everything I came across was aimed at
complete beginners who've never looked at a script, so they walked through all of the fundamentals I already knew, like data types, lists/dictionaries, and logic loops. That's all well and good, but when it came time to apply what I know I found myself staring at a blank IDE with no idea where to start.

My aim is to create functional, practical programs that serve as learn-as-I-code frameworks for various languages so the concepts are immediately applied to my desired work. I don't want to learn everything, I want to learn enough to start using it and then I can learn more as I work with each language more.

## What This Is

* A way to get started and learn the most important 20% of a language that I'll use 80% of the time
* Functional scripts and programs intended for learning, to be used in a safe environment I own
* Extensible with more libraries and features, designed to be augmented as I learn and grow
* A look into my learning journey

## What This Isn't

* Comprehensive-- these are foundational and functional, but not focused on everything... Think of it as learning to play a musical instrument by learning to play a song instead of learning music theory. I already figured out how to install/use an IDE and a debugger, that's not what this is for.
* Polished, tuned, or bulletproof-- these are **NOT** intended for production or to be used in any environment not owned by the user
* For everyone-- if you stumble across this repository and you find this style of learning helpful, that's fantastic! If not, that's okay.
